## What is the Command Line?
The command line interface or CLI refers to a text-based interface for interacting with an operating system. Operating systems include Mac, Windows, and Linux. You access the CLI through a "shell." Popular shell programs include bash, zsh (Mac), Powershell (Windows). 

With the CLI, you interact with the operating system by sending text commands. An example command is shown below.
```sh
pwd
```
`pwd` stands for "Print Working Directory" and causes the shell to print out the current location of the command prompt. 

- terminal 
- command prompt
